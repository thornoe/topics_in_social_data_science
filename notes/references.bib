	abstract = {The emergence of Intelligent Transportation Systems and the associated technologies has increased the need for complex models and algorithms. Namely, real-time information systems, directly influencing transportation demand, must be supported by detailed behavioral models capturing travel and driving decisions. Discrete choice models methodology provide an appropriate framework to capture such behavior. Recently, the Cross-Nested Logit (CNL) model has received quite a bit of attention in the literature to capture decisions such as mode choice, departure time choice and route choice. \%The CNL model is an extension of the Nested Logit model, providing \%more flexibility at the cost of some complexity in the model formulation. In this paper, we develop on the general formulation of the Cross Nested Logit model proposed by Ben-Akiva and Bierlaire (1999) and based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model. We show that it is equivalent to the formulations byby Papola (2004) and Wen and Koppelman (2001). We also show that the formulations by Small(1987) and Vovsha(1997) are special cases of this formulation. We formally prove that the Cross-Nested Logit model is indeed a member of the GEV models family. In doing so, we clearly distinguish between conditions that are necessary to prove consistency with the GEV theory, from normalization conditions. Finally, we propose to estimate the model with non-linear programming algorithms, instead of heuristics proposed in the literature. In order to make it operational, we provide the first derivatives of the log-likelihood function, which are necessary to such optimization procedures.},

	abstract = {Discrete choice models are constantly in evolution in the literature. Since they enable to capture wide range of situations, they have been widely used by researchers and also practitioners in several fields of applications including econometrics and transportation demand analysis. However, estimation procedures are complicated and not always easily available to researchers. BIOGEME is a free software package for estimating by maximum likelihood a broad range of random utility models. It can estimate particularly Multivariate Extreme Value (MEV) models including the logit model, the nested logit model, the cross-nested logit model, and the network MEV model, as well as continuous and discrete mixtures of these models. Biogeme has been designed to provide modelers with tools to investigate a wide variety of discrete choice models without worrying about the estimation algorithm itself. In this paper, we present some new features and capabilities of Biogeme. To make it more flexible, we allow explicitly the user to specify the random utility model to be estimated and the associated likelihood function. With simple formulations, it will be able to handle more sophisticated models such as latent variable models, latent class models, dynamic models, etc. required by modern modeling practice, in particular in transportation.},

	abstract = {We propose a way to estimate a family of static Multivariate Extreme Value (MEV) models with large choice sets in short computational time. The resulting model is also straightforward and fast to use for prediction. Following Daly and Bierlaire (2006), the correlation structure is defined by a rooted, directed graph where each node without successor is an alternative. We formulate a family of MEV models as dynamic discrete choice models on graphs of correlation structures and show that the dynamic models are consistent with MEV theory and generalize the network MEV model (Daly and Bierlaire, 2006). Moreover, we show that these models can be estimated quickly using the concept of network flows and the nested fixed point algorithm (Rust, 1987). The main reason for the short computational time is that the new formulation allows to benefit from existing efficient solution algorithms for sparse linear systems of equations. We present numerical results based on simulated data with varying number of alternatives and nesting structures. We estimate large models, for example, a cross-nested model with 200 nests and 500,000 alternatives and 210 parameters that needs between 100–200 iterations to converge (4.3 h on an Intel(R) 3.2 GHz machine using a non-parallelized code). We also show that our approach allows to estimate a cross-nested logit model of 111 nests with a real data set of more than 100,000 observations in 14 h.},

	abstract = {Discrete choice models are now used in a variety of situations in applied econometrics. By far the model specification which is used most often is the multinomial logit model. Yet it is widely known that a potentially important drawback of the multinomial logit model is the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. While most analysts recognize the implications of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property, it has remained basically a maintained assumption in applications. In the paper we provide two sets of computationally convenient specification tests for the multinomial logit model. The first test is an application of the Hausman [10] specification test procedure. The basic idea for the test here is to test the reverse implication of the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. The test statistic is easy to compute since it only requires computation of a quadratic form which involves the difference of the parameter estimates and the differences of the estimated covariance matrices. The second set of specification tests that we propose is based on more classical test procedures. We consider a generalization of the multinomial logit model which is called the nested logit model. Since the multinomial logit model is a special case of the more general model when a given parameter equals one, classical test procedures such as the Wald, likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier tests can be used. The two sets of specification test procedures care then compared for an example where exact and approximate comparisons are possible.},

The GNL provides a higher degree of flexibility in the estimation of substitution or cross-elasticity between pairs of alternatives than previously developed generalized extreme value (GEV) models. The GNL model includes the paired combinatorial logit (PCL) and cross-nested logit (CNL) models as special cases. It also includes the product differentiation (PD) model, which represents the elasticity structure associated with multi-dimensional choices, and the ordered generalized extreme value model, which represents the elasticity structure associated with ordered alternatives, as special cases. The GNL model includes the two-level nested logit (NL) model as a special case and can approximate closely multi-level nested logit models. It accommodates differential cross-elasticity among pairs of alternatives through the fractional allocation of each alternative to a set of nests, each of which has a distinct logsum or dissimilarity parameter. An empirical example of intercity mode choice confirms the statistical superiority of the GNL model to the paired combinatorial logit, cross-nested logit and nested logit models and indicates important differences in cross-elasticity relationships across pairs of alternatives.},

	abstract = {This chapter gives an overview of discrete choice analysis techniques. First we present a reflection about the meaning of the words ‘discrete’ and ‘choice’. Then we provide an overview of the sorts of choices in passenger and freight transport that have been treated as discrete choice problems. The next section presents the basic random utility theory, upon which most discrete choice models have been based. Different types of discrete choice models are then discussed: the workhorse of discrete choice modelling—the multinomial logit model (MNL), the nested logit and other Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) models, the probit model, the mixed logit and latent class models, ordered response models and aggregate logit models. Then we briefly discuss the estimation of discrete choice models and their application for demand forecasting and for policy simulation. The last section contains a summary and conclusions and a discussion on the future research directions.},

	abstract = {This paper examines a variety of issues within the context of two main themes: the formation of travel demand models and economic evaluation measures which are mutually consistent within a theory of rational choice; and a consideration of the structure of models which are representations of the trip decision process over several dimensions: location, mode, and route. Random utility theory is invoked to explore both the role and properties of composite costs or index prices in the ‘recursive’ approach to the structuring of travel choice models, and their significance in the economic evaluation problem. It is shown that the specification of these costs must be made very precisely, with respect to the demand model form chosen, in order to retain the underlying assumption that the traveller is an optimal decisionmaker. It is argued that the structure of ‘simultaneous’ models currently in use is inconsistent with the form of utility function assumed to generate those models. Furthermore, it is shown that the ‘simultaneous’ and ‘recursive’ forms are special cases of a more general choice model structure which takes specific account of correlation or ‘commonality’ of trip attributes., A number of applications are discussed in which consistent demand models and perceived user benefit measures are constructed. These include the formation of strategic transport planning models and of models for mixed-mode, multimode, and multiroute systems. The formalism allows definitive answers to be given to a number of problems of current interest in transportation planning, which have been incorrectly or incompletely treated.},

	abstract = {We present a summary of important computational issues and opportunities that arise from the use of semi-aggregate data (where the explanatory data for choice scenarios are not necessarily unique for each decision-maker) in discrete choice models. These data are encountered with large transactional databases that have limited consumer information, a common feature in some transportation planning applications, such as airline itinerary choice modeling. We developed a freeware software package called Larch, written in Python and C++, to take advantage of these kind of data to greatly speed the estimation of discrete choice model parameters. Benchmarking experiments against Stata (a commonly used commercial package), Biogeme (a commonly used freeware package), and ALOGIT (a highly specialized commercial package for discrete choice modeling) based on an industry dataset for airline itinerary choice modeling applications shows that the size of the input estimation files are 50–100 times larger in Stata and Biogeme, respectively. Estimation times are also much faster in ALOGIT and Larch; e.g., for a small itinerary choice problem, a multinomial logit model estimated in ALOGIT or Larch converged in less than one second whereas the same model took almost 15 seconds in Stata and more than three minutes in Biogeme.},

The book is oriented to the practitioner. A basic understanding of the linear regression model with matrix algebra is assumed. The text can be used for a microeconometrics course, typically a second-year economics PhD course; for data-oriented applied microeconometrics field courses; and as a reference work for graduate students and applied researchers who wish to fill in gaps in their toolkit. Distinguishing features of the book include emphasis on nonlinear models and robust inference, simulation-based estimation, and problems of complex survey data. The book makes frequent use of numerical examples based on generated data to illustrate the key models and methods. More substantially, it systematically integrates into the text empirical illustrations based on seven large and exceptionally rich data sets.},

	abstract = {A model for choices among uncertain alternatives is developed in which preference between pure alternatives and likelihood judgments between events areassumed to be independent probabilistic processes. It is, in some respects, a probabilistic version of utility models of the von Neumann-Morgenstern type. Certain plausible notions about subjective probability are shown to imply a very simple discrimination function between events in which the probability of choice depends only upon differences of subjective probabilities. Similarly, the expected utility hypothesis is shown to imply that preference discrimination depends upon utility differences, and the form of that discrimination function is determined. Questions of empirical verification are discussed.},
